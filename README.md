# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Ive learned from my course that the best way to understand what users actually want is to break their needs down into simple, clear statements from their point of view called user stories. User stories help with that because they force me to look at the feature through the users eyes instead of just thinking about the code. Instead of just thikning about how im going to build a login screen, a user story shifts it to something direct and focused like, “As a user, I want to log into my account so I can access my saved info.” It gives the feature i build a purpose, which makes it easier to design and test something that really solves the users problem.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
My approach has shifted from plan everything upfront to working in smaller chunks, getting feedback, and adjusting as I go. I will also be implementing TDD moving forward to mimic the agile principles. Agile made that click for me. Id like to use short sprints, backlog prioritizing, and regular checkins with teammates in future projects for sure, because it keeps things moving and prevents problems from piling up or accidental repeats of work. I also really like the idea of Test-Driven Development (TDD) and building tests early, so issues get caught before everything is finished. It just seems way less stressful than fixing everything at the end.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
To me, being a good team member is about communication, being dependable, and not acting like a solo coder hiding in a corner. Its making sure my work fits with the teams goals, being open to feedback, and helping others when i can if im capable. A good teammate doesnt have to be the smartest at all, its just someone who shows up, communicates, and cares about the teams success, not just their tacklng their own problems.
